### Prerequisites
[Java 25](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/) is used for this, if you aren't able to run the program install Java 25.
### Notice
This has only been tested on 64-bit Windows, if it doesn't work on other platforms I'm not providing support.
### Instructions
1. Go download the [latest release](https://github.com/SmushyTaco/Discord-Batch-Delete/releases/latest/) of the Discord Batch Delete program.
2. Run the `.msi` file and install the program.
3. Search for `Discord Batch Delete` and double click it to launch it.
4. Open the DM you'd like to start batch deleting.
5. Press **Start Batch Deleting** and then click into the window that has the DM open. If you accidentally click out of Discord the batch deleter won't mess with anything else, it only runs if your selected window is a Discord one so it's safe from most human error.
6. Just sit and wait while it does it's thing. Once it's done you can press **Stop Batch Deleting** and/or quit the program. Have fun!
