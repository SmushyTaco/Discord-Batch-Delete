### Prerequisites
[Java 17](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/) is used for this, if you aren't able to run the program install Java 17.
### Notice
This has only been tested on 64 bit Windows, if it doesn't work on other platforms I'm not providing support.
### Instructions
1. Go download the [latest release](https://github.com/SmushyTaco/Discord-Batch-Delete/releases/latest/) of the Discord Batch Delete program.
2. Put the file wherever you want on your machine, it really doesn't matter where it goes.
3. Double click it to launch it.
4. Open the DM you'd like to start batch deleting.
5. Press **Start Batch Deleting** and then click into the window that has the DM open. If you accidentally click out of Discord the batch deleter won't mess with anything else, it only runs if your selected window is a Discord one so it's safe.
6. Just sit and wait while it does it's thing. Once it's done you can quit the program and/or press **Stop Batch Deleting**. Have fun!
